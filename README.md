The project was originally applied to bacterial plasmid copy number control but is broadly applicable to single-molecule imaging, protein localization, and cell tracking studies.

Key features include:

Spot Detection Algorithm: Morphological Top-Hat filtering combined with Gaussian fitting for high-precision fluorescent spot detection.

Noise Robustness: Validated on synthetic and real images with reliable detection until SNR â‰ˆ 1.8.

Cell Segmentation & Tracking: Automated segmentation of phase contrast images with lineage reconstruction.

Plasmid Copy Number Estimation: Quantitative correlation of plasmid copy number with cell volume.

MATLAB Implementation: Code written in MATLAB for reproducibility and extensibility.

This work demonstrates a generalizable framework for quantitative, high-throughput single-cell imaging analysis, useful for synthetic biology, molecular microbiology, and systems biology.
